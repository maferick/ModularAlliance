# Docs Index

This directory contains the canonical operational and architectural documentation.

## Key Documents

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` – contracts, request lifecycle, module rules
- `UNIVERSE_RESOLVER.md` – entity types, endpoints, TTL strategy, examples
- `AI_CONTEXT.md` – continuity file to resume development in new AI sessions
- `ROADMAP.md` – planned phases and deliverables

## Why this exists

This project’s biggest risks are:
- schema drift
- “mystery patches”
- undocumented core contracts

These documents exist to keep the platform stable as modules grow.
