# Docs Index

This directory contains the canonical operational and architectural documentation.

## Start here

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` – overall system model (routing, core contracts, caching layers)
- `ROADMAP.md` – milestone-driven roadmap
- `AI_CONTEXT.md` – continuity notes for resuming development safely

## Ops notes

- `rights_notes.md` – RBAC rules of engagement and admin override expectations
- `user_menu_notes.md` – menu areas and visibility rules
- `UNIVERSE_RESOLVER.md` – resolver cache contract and resolver behavior

## Naming note

You may see duplicate docs with different casing (e.g. `AI_CONTEXT.md` and `ai_context.md`).
Uppercase variants are treated as canonical; lowercase variants are kept for compatibility.
